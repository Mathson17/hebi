# Project Name
hey all im mathson a cse student from icet, just experimenting out with pygames making and learning stuff. Hebi (Snake in japanese) is a simple but fun snake game similar to the our traditional snake games that we see every day in Google and many more. I coded it in pycharm using pygane library.

## How it Works ?
Hebi is really easy to play, we have to collect the points using our snake and the snake will grow as we get more points, we have to get maximum points but our snake should not touch its own body nor the boundary, if it does its games over
